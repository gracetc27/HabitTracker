# HabitTracker 
Challenge project 4 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app allows users to add new activities to a list. 
They can click into each activity, view its details, and also press a button to record a practice of the activity.
# Features
- More practice with User defaults.
- @Observable.
- Conforming to codable, identifiable and equatable.
